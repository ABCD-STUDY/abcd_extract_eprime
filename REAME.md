Matlab scripts abcd_extract_eprime_* process the e-prime timing files for the ABCD Study.
The outputs of these scripts are the task timing ready for the AFNI's deconvolution and also behavioral metrics.

To see how the scripts work, see EXAMPLE.m. It process the example e-prime file NDAR_INV0FBX6KWX_WM.txt
Since functions from MMPS are called, please add 'aux' and 'mmil_utils' directories to the matlab path.
